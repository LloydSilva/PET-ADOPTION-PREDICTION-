# PET-ADOPTION-PREDICTION-
1. Analyzed the PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction dataset to predict pet adoption speed, applying supervised learning models to classify adoption rates and identify key factors influencing adoption outcomes. Additionally, unsupervised clustering was used to group pets based on shared attributes, uncovering patterns in adoption behavior.
2. Derived actionable insights to improve pet adoption profiles, helping shelters and rescuers enhance pet visibility and increase adoption rates, ultimately contributing to the reduction of animal euthanasia.


Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction dataset, a tabular dataset designed to predict the adoptability of pets based on various attributes. The original data comes from a Kaggle competition aimed at improving pet adoption rates through the application of machine learning. By understanding and predicting the adoption speed of pets, this project contributes to the development of AI tools that can guide shelters and rescuers in optimizing pet profiles, ultimately reducing animal suffering and euthanasia.

The dataset contains 14,993 instances and 24 features, which include attributes such as the pet's type, age, breed, color, size, vaccination status, and more. For this analysis, we will focus solely on tabular data, excluding image-based features.

Objectives: Our primary goals for this project was as follows:

Supervised Learning: Predict the adoption speed of pets using machine learning models, identifying the key factors influencing adoption rates.
Unsupervised Learning: Group and characterize pets based on their adoption speed and shared attributes using clustering techniques.
To accomplish these objectives, we will use Python 3, leveraging libraries such as Scikit-learn for analysis.

The tasks include thorough data preprocessing, exploration, model building, and result discussion. Special attention will be given to addressing data imbalances, cleaning errors, and ensuring that key decisions and results are justified and critically discussed. By combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, we aim to derive insights that not only predict adoption speed but also provide actionable guidance for improving pet adoption profiles.
